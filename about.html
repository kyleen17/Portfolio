            <h1>My Background</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Kyleen Simon-Robertson. I am indigenous from Wiikwemikoong, Ontario, which is location on beautiful Manitoulin Island. I am a versatile professional with a passion for graphic design, illustration, and web development. I have enhanced my skills through the IndigiTech Mentorship Program, where I earned certifications in Web Development, UX Design, Business, and Digital Marketing. Additionally, I completed a UI Design course with Design Lab. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set that enables me to create impactful designs and innovative digital solutions that meet client expectations and resonate with audiences.  
            </p>
            <p>My journey began as a Sound Recording Technician in Ontario, where I honed my technical proficiency and collaborative skills by working on multiple film productions. This experience, combined with my role as the founder of Manitoulin Music, has allowed me to develop and launch a music theory game, design music resources, publish a book, and mentor students in music theory and piano. These ventures have demonstrated my expertise in digital design, web development, and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
            <p>Since 2013, I have also worked as a private educator, developing curriculums and teaching engaging lessons across Ontario. My educational background includes a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Music from Laurentian University and an Advanced Diploma in Music Performance from Cambrian College, both completed with honours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and bring your creative projects to life.
            </p>
